# THE1.5

I have done this setup on ineks.
## 1. PICSimLab Installation

Firstly, I downloaded the picsim appImage from the [official github page](
    https://github.com/lcgamboa/picsimlab/releases/download/v0.8.12/PICSimLab-0.8.12_230120_Linux_x86_64.AppImage
).

Then I made it executable from the properties menu.

I ran the appImage and it worked.

## 2. MPLAB Configuration

I downloaded the PICSimLab plugin from **odtuclass**. I installed it in the MPLAB X IDE from **Tools -> Plugins -> Downloaded -> Add Plugins**.

Then I opened a new project as shown in the the1.5 pdf.

## 3. PICSimLab Configuration

In PICSimLab I chose **PICGenios** as board, and **PIC18F4620** as microcontroller.

## 4. Testing

I clicked the **Debug Main Project** button and it worked.

In the remaining of the lab, I followed the instructions in the pdf.
